# Development

Inspired by <https://github.com/trinodb/trino/blob/master/.github/DEVELOPMENT.md>.

## Commits and pull requests

### Format Git commit messages

We format commit messages to adhere to the [conventional commit standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
The commit messages are also used to automatically create and version releases using [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release).

### Git merge strategy

Pull requests are usually merged into `master` using the [`rebase and merge`](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#rebase-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) strategy.

A typical pull request should strive to contain a single logical change (but not
necessarily a single commit). Unrelated changes should generally be extracted
into their own PRs.

If a pull request contains a stack of more than one commit, then
popping any number of commits from the top of the stack, should not
break the PR, ie. every commit should build and pass all tests.

Commit messages and history are important as well, because they are
used by other developers to keep track of the motivation behind
changes. Keep logical diffs grouped together in separate commits and
order commits in a way that explains by itself the evolution of the
change. Rewriting and reordering commits is a natural part of the
review process. Mechanical changes like refactoring, renaming, removing
duplication, extracting helper methods, static imports should be kept
separated from logical and functional changes like adding a new feature
or modifying code behaviour. This makes reviewing the code much easier
and reduces the chance of introducing unintended changes in behavior.

Whenever in doubt on splitting a change into a separate commit, ask
yourself the following question: if all other work in the PR needs to
be reverted after merging to master for some objective reason (eg. a
bug has been discovered), is it worth keeping that commit still in
master.

## Code Style

We recommend you use IntelliJ as your IDE. The code style used is the [Google Java style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
It is automatically enforced using [spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless).

To run spotless and other checks before opening a PR: `./gradlew :check`

In addition to those you should also adhere to the following:

### Readability

The purpose of code style rules is to maintain code readability and developer
efficiency when working with the code. All the code style rules explained below
are good guidelines to follow but there may be exceptional situations where we
purposefully depart from them. When readability and code style rule are at odds,
the readability is more important.

### Consistency

Keep code consistent with surrounding code where possible.

### Alphabetize

Alphabetize sections in the documentation source files (both in the table of
contents files and other regular documentation files).

### Use streams

When appropriate, use the stream API. However, note that the stream
implementation does not perform well so avoid using it in inner loops or
otherwise performance sensitive sections.

### Prefer String formatting

Consider using String formatting (printf style formatting using the Java
`Formatter` class): `format("Session property %s is invalid: %s", name, value)`
(note that `format()` should always be statically imported). Sometimes, if you
only need to append something, consider using the `+` operator. Please avoid
`format()` or concatenation in performance critical sections of code.

### Avoid ternary operator

Avoid using the ternary operator except for trivial expressions.

### Define class API for private inner classes too

It is suggested to declare members in private inner classes as public if they
are part of the class API.

### Use AssertJ

Prefer AssertJ for complex assertions.

### Maintain production quality for test code

Maintain the same quality for production and test code.

### Avoid abbreviations

Please avoid abbreviations, slang or inside jokes as this makes harder for
non-native english speaker to understand the code. Very well known
abbreviations like `max` or `min` and ones already very commonly used across
the code base like `ttl` are allowed and encouraged.

### Avoid default clause in exhaustive enum-based switch statements

Avoid using the `default` clause when the switch statement is meant to cover all
the enum values. Handling the unknown option case after the switch statement
allows static code analysis tools (e.g. Error Prone's `MissingCasesInEnumSwitch`
check) report a problem when the enum definition is updated but the code using
it is not.

### Use constructor injection

Prefer [constructor-based dependency injection](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-collaborators.html#beans-constructor-injection)
over field or setter injection.

## Releases

The project aims for frequent releases. We achieve this using semantic-release, where
each merged PR can create a new release. This allows users of the application to quickly
receive bug fixes without waiting for arbitrary release cycles. This only works if the
quality of the code and especially the tests is up-to-par.
